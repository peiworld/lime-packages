## WBMv6 p4u & Jow
## it requires lua nixio from luci-subsignal
##
## This is a test to test the TCP persistence of a mobile node
##
## The server.lua runs in the mobile node and client.lua in the static node
##
## Client is trying to establish a TCP connection to the server. 
## The server's timeout is 2 seconds, so once the path between both nodes
## is lost for more than 2 seconds the socket is closed and the client increase
## the counter variable which counts the number of fails. 
## At the end of the test, the client shows the total number of fails. As less as better.
